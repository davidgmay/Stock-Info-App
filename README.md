README: 

This React App is easy to use, allowing users to enter a stock symbol to receive data on the open price, change in price from open-close for that business day and the percent change. The public API's available were charging a fee to access current prices so I used the open price and have sent out a message through WellFound to confirm that this is acceptable for the assignment. 

To run the application: Upon downloading the files, "npm start" will start the server and run the application. Next, simply enter a stock symbol such as 'googl' and press enter to see data.

Enjoy! 






DOCUMENT: 

For design, I used a component through tremor.so that allowed me to create a table that would display the necessary information, and a search input that allows users to search the stock symbol and receive the data upon pressing enter.

The API used was the IEX Cloud but due to the fact that all other public stock API’s were charging a fee to be given current prices, I did make one adjustment to the assignment prompt and used open price instead of current price. I have reached out and sent a message on WellFound to ask if this is acceptable and hope it is considering it will still display my knowledge and capabilities. 

The most difficult part of the project would be creating the design and styles of the React App simply because there are so many ways to go about it, but because I had previous experience creating React Apps, including in my personal portfolio site, I had background knowledge that allowed me to work efficiently. Ultimately, I sought to make a site that is simply to use and understand that gives the user the information needed in a timely manner. The app that I’ve created can be expanded and information can be added to it to store a wide variety of data.
