This React App is easy to use, allowing users to enter a stock symbol to receive data on the open price, change in price from open-close for that business day and the percent change. The public API's available were charging a fee to access current prices so I used the open price and have sent out a message through WellFound to confirm that this is acceptable for the assignment. 

To run the application: simply enter a stock symbol such as 'googl' and press enter to see data.

Enjoy!
